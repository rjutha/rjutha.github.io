## TECHNICAL SKILLS

R Programming, Python, ...

## **WORK HISTORY**

**Junior Data Analyst**

*Global Affairs Canada – Ottawa, ON* (May 2021 – Dec 2021)

During my 8-month co-op at Global Affairs Canada, I had the opportunity to work as a junior data analyst, contributing to the organization's data-driven decision-making processes. I gained valuable experience in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting complex datasets to generate insights and support evidence-based strategies. I worked on a small data team and we worked on a variety of different projects both independently and as a team.


- Developed an interactive map of China to visualize sister-city relationships.

- Identified unlikely daily word counts in a collection of tweets using a Poisson Process model to uncover trending topics.

- Visualized small datasets as stacked bar charts, density plots, and choropleth maps on short notice as requested by other teams.

- Cleaned a historical dataset by combining multiple years of information using a star schema format for easy integration into Power BI.

- Conducted a factor analysis to create an index to rank countries on classified metrics.

- Developed a logistic regression model to test significance of employee survey results.

**Technical Analyst**

*Centre of Operation Excellence, UBC Sauder – Vancouver, BC* (May 2020 – Aug 2020)

As a Technical Analyst at the Centre of Operation Excellence, UBC Sauder, I designed and implemented advanced logic for ship simulations using Python, optimized code for faster run time, and merged tables using manual string detection techniques using R Code.

- Designed advanced logic for a discrete simulation of ship movements using Python.

- Simulated ship movements in Python using advanced logic.

- Summarized simulation improvements and thoroughly documented code changes.

- Optimized simulation code and cut down run time by over 50%.

- Merged large tables that did not contain a common id using manual string detection.
