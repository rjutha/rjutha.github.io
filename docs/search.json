I gained valuable experience in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting complex datasets to generate insights and support evidence-based strategies. I worked on a small data team and we worked on a variety of different projects both independently and as a team.\n\nDeveloped an interactive map of China to visualize sister-city relationships.\nIdentified unlikely daily word counts in a collection of tweets using a Poisson Process model to uncover trending topics.\nVisualized small datasets as stacked bar charts, density plots, and choropleth maps on short notice as requested by other teams.\nCleaned a historical dataset by combining multiple years of information using a star schema format for easy integration into Power BI.\nConducted a factor analysis to create an index to rank countries on classified metrics.\nDeveloped a logistic regression model to test significance of employee survey results.\n\n\n\nTechnical Analyst\nCentre of Operation Excellence, UBC Sauder – Vancouver, BC (May 2020 – Aug 2020)\nAs a Technical Analyst at the Centre of Operation Excellence, UBC Sauder, I designed and implemented advanced logic for ship simulations using Python, optimized code for faster run time, and merged tables using manual string detection techniques using R Code.\n\nDesigned advanced logic for a discrete simulation of ship movements using Python.\nSimulated ship movements in Python using advanced logic.\nSummarized simulation improvements and thoroughly documented code changes.\nOptimized simulation code and cut down run time by over 50%.\nMerged large tables that did not contain a common id using manual string detection."

I also was able to learn how to cite other papers in LaTex using Overleaf as an IDE.\n\n\nImprovements\nA great addition I would like to make to the paper is to add some coding examples and integrate them into the paper. This would add a great visual interpretation of the results I discuss in the paper"
