## Creating a Shiny UI in a Quarto document

For this week's Tidy Tuesday I experimented with integrating shiny widgets in Quarto files. I took inspiration from Albert Rapp's [article](https://3mw.albert-rapp.de/p/shiny-and-quarto), **3MW (Combining Shiny and Quarto)**, which introduced the idea to me of using Quarto instead of R Markdown [@Rapp2023]. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that utilizes markdown to produce production quality articles, presentations, websites, etc.

## Using Quarto as an alternative to R Markdown

I'm not aware of all the major differences between Quarto and R Markdown but I've been experimenting with Quarto more recently, so much so that I created this blog. I'm enjoying the aesthetic and customization of Quarto and plan to incorporate it into my workflow. I've been reading up on all the features on their [website](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html) that they've added to boost functionality [@Quarto2023]. Noteworthy features for me so far are the **table of contents**, **collapsible code blocks**, and **embedding tools** which combined together generate a clean display. It's also interesting that Quarto can be used for projects coded in other languages like Python further expanding its versatility.

## Hosting on shinyapps.io

Since the website contains interactive shiny widgets, they cannot be rendered on github pages. To share the document I hosted the app on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and embedded the link below. The app can be viewed via this [link](https://sway.shinyapps.io/Spam/). The website contains a short and sweet model building task and allows users to input their own observation for prediction.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 100%
knitr::include_url("https://sway.shinyapps.io/Spam/")
```

## Final Remarks

Integrating Quarto and Shiny is a straightforward process that enhances both aesthetics and functionality, making it an excellent choice for enhancing a project's usability. I'm eager to delve deeper into customizing it further with HTML and CSS themes, as well as learning more ways to take advantage of the framework of Quarto.
