Hello there!

Welcome to the first installment of my blog. This post will split into two main talking points. First I'll be talk about the process of what went into creating this website, specifically the resources I relied on and all the obstacles I encountered during deployment. The second topic will be I'll also use used and how and my future plans for the blog, both in the short term and the long term.

## Why make a Quarto blog or a blog at all for that matter?

this section
talk about

wanted to make a portfolio site -> show off projects 
but was kinda daunting
was simple cause I know R (talk about how it helped)

talk about albert rapps blog post
+ show off a couple of the websites I found while exploring resources

## My plans to update this blog

Short term stuff
share things im currently interested
share new things I learn in utorial fashion
tidy tuesday submissions

long term stuff

creating resources I can fall back on
-> how to use a specific tool and when to use it
Use blog posts to interact withi other data sciencers
talk about psoting publiclally puts me up to scrutiny and how tis relatively double edged but still very beneficial. (other opinons etc)


AlSO to hold myself accoutnable

presenting a problem then solving it
