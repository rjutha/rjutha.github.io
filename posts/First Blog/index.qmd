Hello there!

Welcome to the first installment of my blog. This post will split into two main talking points. First I'll be talk about the process of what went into creating this website, specifically the resources I relied on and all the obstacles I encountered during deployment. The second topic will be I'll also use used and how and my future plans for the blog, both in the short term and the long term.
