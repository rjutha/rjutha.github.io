# Welcome to my portfolio and blog website!

Hey there, fellow data enthusiast! I'm on my way to becoming a data analyst and I'm passionate about all things R, data visualization, and creating with Shiny. 

This little corner of the internet is where I get to flaunt some of the cool data projects I've been tinkering with. It's also my personal hub for writing article tutorials that I can revisit down the line. 

Don't be shy â€“ if you've got questions or thoughts about anything I've been up to, I'm all ears and super excited to chat!
