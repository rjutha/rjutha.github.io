I gained valuable experience in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting complex datasets to generate insights and support evidence-based strategies. I worked on a small data team and we worked on a variety of different projects both independently and as a team.\n\n\n- Developed an interactive map of China to visualize sister-city relationships.\n\n- Identified unlikely daily word counts in a collection of tweets using a Poisson Process model to uncover trending topics.\n\n- Visualized small datasets as stacked bar charts, density plots, and choropleth maps on short notice as requested by other teams.\n\n- Cleaned a historical dataset by combining multiple years of information using a star schema format for easy integration into Power BI.\n\n- Conducted a factor analysis to create an index to rank countries on classified metrics.\n\n- Developed a logistic regression model to test significance of employee survey results.\n\n### **Technical Analyst**\n\n*Centre of Operation Excellence, UBC Sauder – Vancouver, BC (May 2020 – Aug 2020)*\n\nAs a Technical Analyst at the Centre of Operation Excellence, UBC Sauder, I designed and implemented advanced logic for ship simulations using Python, optimized code for faster run time, and merged tables using manual string detection techniques using R Code.\n\n- Designed advanced logic for a discrete simulation of ship movements using Python.\n\n- Simulated ship movements in Python using advanced logic.\n\n- Summarized simulation improvements and thoroughly documented code changes.\n\n- Optimized simulation code and cut down run time by over 50%.\n\n- Merged large tables that did not contain a common id using manual string detection.\n\n## **EDUCATION**\n\n### **Bachelor of Science, Statistics Major**\n\n*Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC (Sept 2017 - June 2023)*\n\n- Bachelor of Science, Major: Statistics.\n\n## **PERSONAL PROJECTS**\n\n### **Board Game Dice Distribution Visualizer** \n\n*RStudio/R Shiny (June 2023)*\n\n[*https://sway.shinyapps.io/Cthulhu-Death-May-Die-Dice-Distributions*](https://sway.shinyapps.io/Cthulhu-Death-May-Die-Dice-Distributions)\n\n- Developed an optimized algorithm to simulate non-standard dice rolls for the popular board game Cthulhu: Death May Die, resulting in an improved gameplay experience.\n\n- Created an engaging and visually appealing Shiny App utilizing custom themes and fonts.\n\n- Implemented interactive features that enable users to effortlessly modify parameters and access information.\n\n## **GRANTS AND AWARDS**\n\n**NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award** *(June 2020 - Aug 2020)*\n\n- Research award valued at $4,500 awarded.\n\n## **CERTIFICATIONS**\n\n**Massachusetts Institute of Technology** *(June 2019 - July 2019)*\n\n- Online Course: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python.\n\n## **PORTFOLIO & MISCELLANEOUS PROJECTS**\n\n#### A Selection of smaller-scale portfolio items and miscellaneous projects.\n\n### **Marvel Movies Data Exploration**\n\n*RStudio (Feb 2020)*\n\n[https://rjutha.github.io/MCU-Movie-Project](https://rjutha.github.io/MCU-Movie-Project)\n\n- Scraped movie revenue, profits, and ratings from Wikipedia.\n\n- Brainstormed research questions like whether the gross profit margins have increased.\n\n- Cleaned the data and created plots to visualize trends to answer project questions.\n\n- Visualized metrics like historical profitability, production costs, and movie ratings.\n\n### **International Tourism Dashboard** \n\n*RStudio (June 2023)*\n\n[https://rjutha.github.io/International-Tourism-Data-Project](https://rjutha.github.io/International-Tourism-Data-Project)\n\n- Cleaned Excel sheets from World Bank using Tidyverse R functions.\n\n- Created interactive choropleth maps incorporating tooltips and zoom functionality.\n\n- Summarized visualizations using Flexdashboard to enhance accessibility and sharing.\n\n## **Comparing Parametric and Non-parametric Tests**\n\n*LaTeX (March 2020)*\n\n[*https://github.com/rjutha/Comparing-Parametric-and-Non-Parametric-Tests*](https://github.com/rjutha/Comparing-Parametric-and-Non-Parametric-Tests/)\n\nThe goals of this project was to practice technical writing, learn LaTex, and introduce myself to reading statistic papers. This was originally a short paper I wrote as a final project to one of my classes. I chose a simple topic that I had interest in and had a lot of fun writing the paper. I also was able to learn how to cite other papers in LaTex using Overleaf as an IDE."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"cv.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.475","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"About Me/CV"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
