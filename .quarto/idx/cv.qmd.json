I gained valuable experience in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting complex datasets to generate insights and support evidence-based strategies. I worked on a small data team and we worked on a variety of different projects both independently and as a team.\n\n\n- Developed an interactive map of China to visualize sister-city relationships.\n\n- Identified unlikely daily word counts in a collection of tweets using a Poisson Process model to uncover trending topics.\n\n- Visualized small datasets as stacked bar charts, density plots, and choropleth maps on short notice as requested by other teams.\n\n- Cleaned a historical dataset by combining multiple years of information using a star schema format for easy integration into Power BI.\n\n- Conducted a factor analysis to create an index to rank countries on classified metrics.\n\n- Developed a logistic regression model to test significance of employee survey results.\n\n**Technical Analyst**\n\n*Centre of Operation Excellence, UBC Sauder – Vancouver, BC* (May 2020 – Aug 2020)\n\nAs a Technical Analyst at the Centre of Operation Excellence, UBC Sauder, I designed and implemented advanced logic for ship simulations using Python, optimized code for faster run time, and merged tables using manual string detection techniques using R Code.\n\n- Designed advanced logic for a discrete simulation of ship movements using Python.\n\n- Simulated ship movements in Python using advanced logic.\n\n- Summarized simulation improvements and thoroughly documented code changes.\n\n- Optimized simulation code and cut down run time by over 50%.\n\n- Merged large tables that did not contain a common id using manual string detection.\n\n## **EDUCATION**\n\n**Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC** (Sept 2017 - June 2023)\n\n- Bachelor of Science, Major: Statistics.\n\n## **PERSONAL PROJECTS**\n\n## GRANTS AND AWARDS\n\n**NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award** (June 2020 - Aug 2020)\n\n- Research award valued at $4,500 awarded.\n\n## CERTIFICATIONS\n\n**Massachusetts Institute of Technology** (June 2019 - July 2019)\n\n- Online Course: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python.\n\n## **PORTFOLIO & MISCELLANEOUS PROJECTS**\n\nAdd smaller projects / school projects here. \n\nTHEY MUST LINK TO SOMETHING TANGIBLE."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"cv.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.475","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"CV"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
