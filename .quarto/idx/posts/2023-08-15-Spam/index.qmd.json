I took inspiration from Albert Rapp's [article](https://3mw.albert-rapp.de/p/shiny-and-quarto), **3MW (Combining Shiny and Quarto)**, which introduced the idea to me of using Quarto instead of R Markdown [@Rapp2023]. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that utilizes markdown to produce production quality articles, presentations, websites, etc.\n\n## Using Quarto as an alternative to R Markdown\n\nI'm not aware of all the major differences between Quarto and R Markdown but I've been experimenting with Quarto more recently, so much so that I created this blog. I'm enjoying the aesthetic and customization of Quarto and plan to incorporate it into my workflow. I've been reading up on all the features on their [website](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html) that they've added to boost functionality [@Quarto2023]. Noteworthy features for me so far are the **table of contents**, **collapsible code blocks**, and **embedding tools** which combined together generate a clean display. It's also interesting that Quarto can be used for projects coded in other languages like Python further expanding its versatility.\n\n## Hosting on shinyapps.io\n\nSince the website contains interactive shiny widgets, they cannot be rendered on github pages. To share the document I hosted the app on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and embedded the link below. The app can be viewed via this [link](https://sway.shinyapps.io/Spam/). The website contains a short and sweet model building task and allows users to input their own observation for prediction.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 100%\nknitr::include_url(\"https://sway.shinyapps.io/Spam/\")\n```\n\n## Final Remarks\n\nIntegrating Quarto and Shiny is a straightforward process that enhances both aesthetics and functionality, making it an excellent choice for enhancing a project's usability. I'm eager to delve deeper into customizing it further with HTML and CSS themes, as well as learning more ways to take advantage of the framework of Quarto.\n\n## References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.475","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"page-layout":"article","title":"Tidy Tuesday Week 33: A simple brms model for predicting spam emails","description":"Usings BRMS and Shiny to create an interactive spam prediction app.","bibliography":["resource.bib"],"twitter-card":{"image":"featured.png"},"author":[{"name":"Rahim Jutha","url":"https://rjutha.github.io/"}],"date":"09-05-2023","categories":["Data-Viz","R","TidyTuesday","Shiny","Bayesian"],"citation":{"url":"https://rjutha.github.io/posts/2023-08-15-Spam/"},"image":"featured.png","draft":false},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
